    "text": "Welcome to the Aurelia Users Community Space. We are a group of developers who use and love the Aurelia framework. Our mission is to create well written guides, blogs, tutorials, code snippets, and other technical resources, written by Aurelia developers for Aurelia developers. AUCS content starts where the official Aurelia documentation ends: we don't cover every part of the Aurelia API but rather show you how to put it all together to create excellent webapps.",

    "text": "You can access all of the AUCS guides and resources through this portal, and help us develop it further on GitHub. All our content is written in markdown files. Our hope is that over time, each of these documents will find its way onto the official Aurelia HUB. You can also find our blog here, and access surveys that are used to determine where we concentrate our efforts. AUCS guides are written for you, the developer. It is important to us that your voice is taken into account.",
